## Description

This website generates high quality bus stop signs from GTFS zip files. By default, it uses the GTFS file for Vancouver, BC's Translink. 

I heard that the largest reason for poor signage is due to the frequency of how often the routes get updated, so I wanted to create an efficient way for people to improve the signs through guerilla/tactical urbanism. I was inspired to make the website from this video:

## TODO

- Mass download of bus signs for large areas.
- Make lines look smoother when merging or splitting.
