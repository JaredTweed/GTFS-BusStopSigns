## Description

This website generates high quality bus stop signs from GTFS zip files. By default, it uses the GTFS file for Vancouver, BC's Translink which can be found [here](https://www.translink.ca/about-us/doing-business-with-translink/app-developer-resources/gtfs/gtfs-data). 

I heard that the largest reason for poor signage is due to the frequency of how often the routes get updated, so I wanted to create an efficient way for people to improve the signs through guerilla/tactical urbanism. I was inspired to make the website from this video:
